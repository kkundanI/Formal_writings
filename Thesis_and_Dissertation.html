    <h2 id="Comparative-Case-Study">Comparative Case Study</h2>
<p>A Comparative Case Study involves the systematic analysis and comparison of multiple cases to gain insights, identify patterns, or explore variations related to a research topic. It involves examining similarities and differences among the cases to generate meaningful conclusions. Here is an example of how a Comparative Case Study can be formatted:</p>
