          <li>3.6. Incident Reporting and Documentation: Document all relevant details of the incident, including actions taken, findings, and recommendations, for future reference, auditing, and reporting purposes.</li>
          <li>3.7. Incident Recovery and Lessons Learned: Restore affected systems and operations to normal functionality, review the incident response process, identify areas for improvement, and incorporate lessons learned into future incident response planning and training.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>4. Roles and Responsibilities</h4>
      <p>Clear roles and responsibilities will be defined for incident response activities. The following roles will be assigned:</p>
      <ul>

          <li>4.3. Incident Reporting Contacts: Designated contacts to whom employees and stakeholders should report any suspected or confirmed security incidents.</li>
          <li>4.4. Support Teams: Various teams, such as IT, HR, Legal, Communications, and Management, may be involved in supporting the incident response process based on the nature and severity of the incident.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>5. Incident Communication</h4>
      <p>Clear communication channels and procedures will be established to ensure effective and timely communication throughout the incident response process. This includes internal communication among relevant teams and departments, as well as external communication with customers, partners, regulators, and law enforcement agencies as required by applicable laws and regulations.</p>
  
      <h4>6. Training and Awareness</h4>
      <p>All employees and stakeholders involved in incident response activities will receive appropriate training and awareness on this policy, incident handling procedures, their roles and responsibilities, and reporting requirements. Regular training and awareness programs will be conducted to ensure ongoing readiness and competence.</p>
  
      <h4>7. Review and Update</h4>
